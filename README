This repository contains the scripts to use CURRENNT

./waveform-modeling

  - DATA
  Directory to store the data for model training (validation will be selected
  automatically from these data)

  - TESTDATA
  Directory to store the data for test
  
  - TESTDATA-for-pretrained
  Directory to store the data for test for the project-WaveNet-pretrained
  and project-NSF-pretrained

  - SCRIPTS
  Scripts of the training/generation processes

  - project-NSF-pretrained
  Neural source-filter model trained on SLT. This is a demonstration
  script to generate waveforms from a trained NSF model.
  The samples have been uploaded to https://nii-yamagishilab.github.io/samples-nsf/
  
  - project-NSF-scripts
  Scripts to train NSF on CMU-arctic SLT voice. 

  - project-WaveNet-pretrained
  Wavenet trained on SLT. This is a demonstration
  script to generate waveforms from a trained WaveNet model.
  The samples have been uploaded to https://nii-yamagishilab.github.io/samples-nsf/

  - project-WaveNet-scripts
  Scripts to train WaveNet on CMU-arctic SLT voice. 


Usage:
1. For quick check
   $: source ./init.sh
   $: cd waveform-modeling/project-NSF-pretrained/
   $: run 01_gen.sh

   Waveforms should be generated in ./waveform-modeling/project-NSF-pretrained/MODELS/NSF/output
   
2. For model training using the provided sample data (only a few utterances from CMT-arctic)
   $: source ./init.sh
   $: cd waveform-modeling/project-NSF/
   $: run 00_run.sh
   
   After which you can get a trained model in ./waveform-modeling/project-NSF/MODELS/NSF/trained_network.jsn

   $: run 01_get.sh
   After which you can get some waveforms in ./waveform-modeling/project-NSF/MODELS/NSF/output

3. For training using your own data:
   1. Put waveforms and acoustic features in ./DATA, which stores the training data (validation data will be
      automatically selected from ./DATA)
   2. Read and configure config.py in project-NSF or project-Wavenet
   3. Run 00_run.sh
   4. Put test data in ./TESTDATA, configure config.py and Run 01_get.sh


Note:
   This script assumes 16kHz waveform, acoustic features extracted with frame_shift = 5ms.
   Otherwise, please email me on how to modify network.jsn for model training.
   (We will add automatic configuration later)
